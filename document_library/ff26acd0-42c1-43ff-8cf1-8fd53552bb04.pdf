("LIHTC") program as defined by Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code and if Resident leases the Premises

is contingent upon Resident providing Management with required information necessary to recertify Resident's

D7A4B0EF10 CONDITION AND CARE OF PREMISES:
10.1 Condition: Resident shall not change locks, paint, decorate or alter in any way the Premises without the
prior written permission from Management and shall not interfere with the quiet use and enjoyment by other
residents of the community. Further, Resident shall comply with all state statutes and city ordinances which are
applicable to the Premises and common areas. Resident has carefully inspected the Premises and finds them to be
in a clean, habitable, undamaged condition except as may be noted on the apartment Inspection/Check Out Report.
This Report will be used to determine refund of security deposit amount at the end of Resident's tenancy. Resident
may be present at the Management's move out inspection.
Management shall not be liable to Resident's family, invitees and occupants for any damage to person or property
caused by the act or neglect of any other resident or non-resident at the community.
10.2 Care: Resident agrees to exercise reasonable care in the use of the Premises, furnishings and community
and to maintain and redeliver the same in a clean and safe condition, free from damage, unsightly debris, equipment
or decor. Resident agrees to pay for all repairs, replacements and maintenance caused by his misconduct or
negligence, that of his family, invitees, and occupants, and, at the option of Management, such charges shall be due
and payable immediately or shall be regarded as additional rent to be paid no later than the next date on which rent
is due following such repairs. Resident shall immediately report to Mark-Taylor Residential in writing when any
locks, equipment, fixtures, furnishings or portion of the Premises have been damaged or are out of repair. Any
damage to the Premises, fixtures or furnishings contained therein which is not otherwise explained in writing to
Management within three (3) days after occurrence thereof, shall be presumed to have resulted from the Resident's
neglect. Resident shall not allow a legally or physically inoperable vehicle to remain on the common areas or any
other portion of the community for more than twenty-four (24) hours. No car repairs are to be made in or on the
common areas or any other portion of the community. Any vehicle inoperable or in disrepair shall be subject to
towing at the vehicle owner's expense. Vehicles with expired tags are considered to be improperly parked at the
community and, therefore, a violation of the Lease.
10.3 Vinyl Plank Flooring: Certain apartment communities managed by Mark-Taylor Residential, Inc. have vinyl
plank flooring in the apartments. An elegant departure from boring, traditional flooring such as carpeting or linoleum,
vinyl plank flooring is nonetheless considered to be a noisier surface than these other materials. If the apartment
does have vinyl plank flooring installed therein Resident is hereby advised that such flooring is generally
characterized as a noisier surface than non-vinyl flooring. Despite the characteristics that cause the increased
potential for noise, the building has been constructed in such a way to minimize this increased noise possibility.
Such efforts to abate additional noise include the following:
Insulation: The floor insulation is R30. Normally, it is only R13 for apartments. As the "R-value" increases, so too
does the insulation effectiveness for both temperature and noise.
Sound wave channeling: Resilient metal channels have been installed between the drywall and the joist/floor
member to absorb and redirect sound waves
While the above-mentioned noise abatement techniques were employed, Landlord cannot ensure that all noise will
be absorbed by these enhancements to the building. Accordingly, Resident acknowledges that Management
strongly recommends, in consideration of Resident's neighbors, that Resident utilize area rugs throughout the
dwelling unit. Resident agrees to hold Management harmless for claims arising from or relating in any way to noise
associated with or caused by the vinyl plank flooring.
10.4 Amenities: Resident acknowledges that the use of the swimming pool area, the lounge, and other related
amenities at the community are being furnished without charge by Management and that no guard or other
supervision over the use of said swimming pool and facilities will be provided; and, fully under- stands the risks
associated with the use of these facilities. Resident hereby assumes for himself, his family, occupants, and guests
any and all risks associated with the use of said pool and facilities, and agrees that Management shall not be liable
for any harm sustained by Resident, his family occupants, or guests in connection with said risks. Resident further
understands and agrees that the use of any facility or amenity on the community is restricted to Resident and
Resident’s family, occupants, and guests, and that express consent must be given by Management prior to another
person's use of such facility or amenity. Resident hereby acknowledges that the amenities provided at this
community are subject to change at the sole discretion of Management. Further, Resident acknowledges that its use
of the community amenities is a privilege under the terms of this Lease and subject to revocation by Management
should Resident improperly use said amenities or engage in conduct that is disruptive to other resident's use and/or
enjoyment of the community amenities. Further, Resident acknowledges that Management may discontinue any use
of a community amenity or restrict access to said amenity in response to any public health emergency or at the order
of any state, county, or local official. Notwithstanding anything appearing in this paragraph to the contrary, the
Resident does not agree to the exculpation or limitation of any liability of Management arising under law or to
indemnify Management for that liability or costs connected therewith.Emerson Mill Avenue

given during the current lease term (identified in section 1.1). Approval for any transfer shall be granted solely at the
discretion of the Community Manager and inquiring Resident must meet all application standards at the time of the
transfer application. Upon Management's approval of Resident's requested transfer, the transfer fee stated above shall be
paid within two (2) days or else the transfer will automatically be terminated. Transfers will not be approved prior to an
inspection of the apartment by the Community Manager or his/her designee. In advance of the transfer, Resident must
pay all fees and deposits for the transferred apartment, as Management does not transfer deposits to a new apartment,

Premises and/or the community and/or community amenities, or negligence by Resident, Resident's guests, or
occupants. Management may require payment at any time, including advance payment of repairs for which you're liable.
Delay in demanding sums you owe is not a waiver. Failure to reimburse Management for damages associated with a
breach of this provision shall be considered a breach of the Lease entitling Management to the relief authorized by A.R.S.
§§ 33-1368(A) and 33-1377. It is agreed and understood that the remedies provided for in this provision are in addition to
the remedies prescribed for in A.R.S. § 33-1369.

otherwise engage in conduct that poses a risk to the health, safety, and/or welfare of the community, its residents, or
members of the on-site management team in violation of A.R.S. § 33-1368(A). Further, Resident and its guests or
occupants may not engage in any disruptive behavior on community grounds that disturbs or threatens the rights,
comfort, safety, health, or welfare of other residents or Management's agents and/or employees, on or near the
apartment community, or disrupt the business operations of the community.
15 NON-DISPARAGEMENT: While Resident is free to engage in lawful conduct as authorized by The Consumer Review

within the Premises, Resident automatically grants to Management the right of immediate entry into Premises pursuant to
A.R.S. § 33-1343(B).
17 DEFAULT: The failure by either Resident or Management to fully perform this Lease in any manner shall entitle either
party to take all actions against the defaulting party as provided by law. Any notice issued by Management to Resident for
any breach of the Lease or any of the accompanying addenda shall be subject to a notice fee of $55.00due and owing as
additional rent under the terms of this Lease.
18 SUBORDINATION: This Lease is and shall remain subordinate to any ground lease, mortgage, trust deed, or other
encumbrance or security instrument now existing or hereafter to be placed upon the Premises and to any modifications,
extensions, replacements and advances in connection therewith. Resident shall attorn to the Apartment Community

otherwise, so long as Lender agrees not to disturb the Resident if Resident is not in default under the Lease.

resident's property, subject to A.R.S. § 33-1370.
20 NON-WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY: The failure of Management to insist upon the strict performance of the terms,
covenants, and conditions herein contained shall not be deemed a waiver of any of Management's rights or remedies

Agreement will remain in effect and both Management and Resident will continue to be bound by them.
21 BINDING EFFECT: This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors,

22 APARTMENT COMMUNITY POLICIES: The policies and rules provided in Schedule "A," the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, are deemed a part of this Agreement and a breach of any rule by Resident or his/her guest(s) or
invitee(s) shall constitute a default hereunder. Pursuant to A.R.S. § 33-1342, from time to time, may adopt rules or

any of its agents or employees, is engaging in unlawful discrimination in violation of these laws is encouraged to
communicate these concerns to Management's corporate office.
27 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS: Reasonable accommodations are changes in rules, policies, practices or
services that are reasonably necessary to provide a person with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a

explanation of why he/she needs the accommodation. This request for an accommodation may be made by a person with
a disability or by any other person acting on behalf of such person. Management reserves the right to seek other
information, including medical information, if it determines that it needs that information to determine whether a request
for an accommodation is reasonable. If Management determines that a person with a disability needs the
accommodation, management will grant the request unless doing so will impose an undue hardship, including an undue
financial or administrative burden, or will substantially change the nature of the program that the property offers. Any
person who believes that an accommodation request was improperly denied is encouraged to address those concerns to
Management's corporate office.

reasonably necessary to provide a person with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. No structural
changes may be made without the approval of Management. Any person who needs a modification of the dwelling

CRIME-FREE AND DRUG-FREE HOUSING LEASE ADDENDUM
A. ADDENDUM
In consideration of the execution or renewal of the Lease for the dwelling unit identified in said Lease as the Premises,
Management and Resident agree as follows:
1.Resident, any members of Resident's household, any guest of Resident or Resident's household, or other person under
the control of Resident, shall not engage in criminal activity, including drug-related criminal activity, on or near the
Premises. "Drug-related criminal activity" means the illegal manufacture, sale, distribution, use, or possession with intent
to manufacture, sell, distribute, or use of a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances
Act (21 U.S.C. § 802)).
2.Resident, any members of Resident's household, any guest of Resident or Resident's household, or other person under
the control of Resident, shall not engage in any act intended to facilitate criminal activity, including drug-related criminal
activity, on or near the Premises, nor shall they permit the dwelling unit to be used for or to facilitate criminal activity,
including drug-related criminal activity.
3.Resident, any members of Resident's household, any guest of Resident or Resident's household, or other person under
the control of Resident, shall not engage in the unlawful manufacturing, selling, using, storing, keeping, or giving of a
controlled substance as defined under relevant municipal code or State or Federal law at any location, whether on or near
the Premises or elsewhere.
4.Resident, any members of Resident's household, any guest of Resident or Resident's household, or other person under
the control of Resident, shall not engage in any illegal activity that is detrimental to the safety and conditions of the
Premises and the community, including but not limited to homicide; burglary; arson; robbery; kidnapping; rape;
prostitution; criminal street gang activity; threatening or intimidating behavior; assault and/or battery; improper,
impermissible, or illegal discharge of firearms; attempts or conspiracy to commit thereof; or any breach of the Lease that
otherwise jeopardizes the health, safety, and welfare of Management's agents or other residents of the community or
involving imminent and/or serious property damage (as respectively defined under relevant municipal code or State or
Federal law).
5.A single violation of any of the provisions set forth above shall be deemed by Management as a breach of the Lease that
is both material and irreparable and therefore as good cause for termination of Resident's tenancy. Resident hereby
understands and agrees that any such violation shall be grounds for immediate termination as permitted by law. Resident
further understands and agrees that, unless otherwise prohibited by law or ordinance, proof of violation shall require
neither criminal conviction nor proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather adjudged as more likely than not by the
preponderance of the evidence.
6.Should a conflict exist between the provisions of this Addendum and those set forth in the Lease, the provisions set forth
herein shall govern and be controlling.
7.The provisions set forth herein are material to this Addendum and the Lease. If any provision (or portion thereof) is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be impermissible or invalid, the offensive provision (or portion thereof) shall be
severed and all other provisions (or portions thereof) shall remain in full force and effect.
8.Through the execution of this Addendum below, its terms and conditions shall be incorporated into the Lease.

and between Emerson MillAvenue (hereinafter "Management") and Shenoy GlenGladwin, MradulKumar,Kshitiz
Chaurasia, andSankalp SharmaMadgula (hereinafter "Resident"), the leaseholder for the premises known as 101W5th
Street#3035,Tempe,AZ85281.
REPRESENTATIONS
WHEREAS bedbugs have become a problem facing the owners of residential rental properties, their agents in managing those
residential rental properties, and the residents of those same residential rental properties; and
WHEREAS the owners and residents agree that policies need to be established to control these pests; and
WHEREAS the owners and residents desire to clearly define their roles in handling incursions by these pests
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Addendum agree to add the following terms and conditions to the residential lease
contract that exists between these parties to set forth a clear understanding of the responsibilities of both Resident and
Management under the Lease Agreement with the desire that by setting forth these mutual responsibilities as part of the
Addendum, the parties can minimize the costs, inconveniences and misunderstandings that often result from pest infestation.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
1.This Addendum hereby supplements and modifies the Lease Agreement between the parties, and it shall be incorporated
as a part of the Lease Agreement. Where there are provisions that conflict between this Addendum and the Lease
Agreement, the provisions set forth herein shall supersede and be controlling.
2.For purposes of this Addendum, "bedbugs" or "pests" means any insect of the genus cimex (including, but not limited to,
cimex lectu larius), and/or its eggs. "Pest infestation" means the presence of pests that may materially affect the health
and safety of residents and their guests.
3.Management and Resident will be honest in their communications regarding the presence of pests at the property. In that
regard, Management will not enter into any Lease Agreement to lease a unit that Management knows is infested.
4.Resident agrees that he/she has read the bedbug educational materials handout provided by Management and states
one of the following:
Resident is not aware of any infestation or presence of bedbugs in your current or previous apartment, home or
dwelling. Resident agrees that he/she is not aware of any bedbug infestation or presence in any of his/her furniture,
clothing, personal property or possessions. Resident further agrees that he/she has not been subjected to conditions in
which there was any bedbug infestation or presence.
Resident agrees that if he/she previously lived anywhere that had a bedbug infestation that all of his/her personal
property (including furniture, clothing and other belongings) have been treated by a licensed pest control professional.
Resident agrees that such items are free of further infestation. If Resident discloses a previous experience of bedbug
infestation, Management may review documentation of the treatment and may inspect Resident's personal property and
possessions to confirm the absence of bedbugs. Resident previously experienced a bedbug infestation as follows:
5.The parties agree that any failure to respond truthfully to paragraph 4 above constitutes a material misrepresentation of
the Lease Agreement and is grounds for termination of tenancy pursuant to A.R.S. § 33-1368(A)(2).
6.If Resident fails to report any pest infestation and/or problems with the Premises within seven(7)days of move-in, it shall
be an acknowledgement by Resident that the premises are acceptable, in good condition and pest free.
7.After move-in, Management will take immediate steps to address any identified pest infestation problem. Resident
acknowledges that time is of the essence in dealing with issues of potential pest infestation. Because of this need for
prompt action to avoid any further infestation, Resident shall report any actual or suspected infestation within forty-eight
(48)hoursof discovery. Pursuant to the requirements of the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, all such
reports must be in a written or electronic format.
8.Resident may be required to pay all reasonable costs of cleaning and pest control treatments incurred by management to
treat Resident's dwelling unit for bedbugs. If Management confirms the presence or infestation of bedbugs after Resident
vacates the dwelling, Resident may be responsible for the cost of cleaning and pest control treatments. If ManagementEmerson Mill Avenue

may be liable for payment of any lost rental income and other expenses incurred by Management to relocate the
neighboring residents and/or to clean and perform pest control treatments to eradicate infestations in those other
dwellings. Resident agrees that if he/she fails to pay Management for any costs for which Resident is liable, Resident will
be in default of his/her lease and Management will have the right to terminate Resident's right of occupancy and exercise
all other rights and remedies under the lease agreement.
9.Resident acknowledges that used or second-hand furniture is the primary way that bed bugs are spread. Resident agrees
that he/ she will not knowingly or recklessly bring onto the property furniture or other belongings that are infested with
bedbugs. Resident further agrees to exercise caution when acquiring used or second-hand furniture and shall examine
any such items thoroughly before bringing them into the dwelling. Resident further agrees that Resident shall not bring
into the dwelling those used or second-hand furniture items that have been abandoned or discarded in such areas as
roadsides, trash rooms, and disposal receptacles.
10.In the event that there is a bedbug infestation in Resident's apartment, Resident agrees to cooperate fully with and to
undertake all efforts and tasks required by Management, and in Management's sole discretion, or by Management's pest
control company, employed to eradicate pests. Resident's full cooperation includes but is not limited to reporting any
suspected pest infestation to Management in a written or electronic format within forty-eight (48)hoursof discovery,
making the premises available for entry to complete pest inspection and eradication treatment(s), completing all required
pre-treatment activities, evacuating the premises during and after treatment for the required time frame, completing all
required post-treatment activities, and immediately reporting ineffective treatment or re-infestations to Management in
writing.
11.Resident and Management further agree that any violation of this Addendum constitutes a material violation of the Lease,
and Management may terminate Resident's right to possession upon issuance of a five(5)dayday notice for a health
and safety violation. Conduct that constitutes such a material health and safety breach includes failure to promptly notify
Management of evidence of any pest infestation, refusal to permit Management to enter to inspect for infestation or to
perform eradication treatments, and failure to complete all required pre-treatment and post treatment activities, including
a failure to report ineffective treatment or re-infestations. Proof of the violation of this Addendum shall be by a
preponderance of the evidence.
12.Resident may request reasonable extermination services at any time. All requests must be in writing. Upon notification
from Resident, Management shall visually inspect the unit for household pests, preferably within forty-eight (48)hours,
and should a pest infestation be identified, shall begin the process of controlling the household pests within ten(10)days
of such notice. When Management requires access to a dwelling unit for purposes of inspecting for the presence of a
household pest or controlling the presence of a household pest, Management shall provide at least twenty-four (24)
hoursnotice to Resident, in writing, that Management requires such immediate access. Management will notify Resident
in advance of each pest inspection, including providing a preparation sheet. If Resident notifies Management of a
possible infestation and requests extermination services, the notice from Resident constitutes permission to enter the
dwelling unit for the sole purpose of acting on the inspection or extermination request. Management will not abuse the
right to access or use it to harass Resident and will enter only at reasonable times.
13.Except in those situations where Management has been grossly negligent, and/or as provided by law, Owner,
Management, and its employees, officers, and/or directors are not liable to Resident for any damages caused by pests,
including, but not limited to, personal expenses, replacement of furniture, and/or other personal items, including clothing,
medications or medical expenses, or for the costs to treat, clean, replace and/or protect Resident's personal belongings.
Owner, Management, and its employees, officers, and directors, are not responsible for any damage done to Resident's
unit or personal items during pest control inspections and/or treatments. Renter's insurance is strongly recommended
and/or required, but it may also exclude coverage related to pest infestation issues.
14.Resident acknowledges that Management's adoption of this Addendum, and the efforts to provide a pest free
environment, does not in any way change the standard of care that Management owes Resident under the Lease.
Resident further acknowledges that Manage- ment does not guarantee or warranty a pest-free environment. Resident
acknowledges and understands that Management's ability to police, monitor, or enforce the agreements of the Addendum
is dependent in significant part on Resident's voluntary cooperation and compliance.
15.Management agrees that it will attempt to make reasonable accommodations in the event that any disabled Resident
requests such an accommodation in connection with pest control service. Any Resident requesting such an
accommodation is requested to provide notice to Management at the time that the pest control service is requested or
when Resident receives notice that it will be provided, whichever is earlier. Resident understands that in some
circumstances, because of the nature of a particular pest or infestation, there may not be alternative, effective means of
eradication, and in those circumstances, Management must use the eradication services that are effective in dealing with
the infestation.Emerson Mill Avenue

D7A4B0EFNOTICE TO RESIDENTS ABOUT BEDBUGS
A.R.S. § 33-1319, which was enacted by the Arizona legislature in 2011, requires landlords to provide educational materials
about bedbugs to new and existing residents. Although we sincerely hope that you will never experience any incidents of
bedbugs, we also recognize that it has become a common occurrence throughout the United States. Bedbugs attack rich and
poor and are increasingly found in expensive hotels, department stores, hospitals, schools, airports and other locations where
people gather, in addition to apartments. While it may not ever be possible to completely eliminate the potential for bedbugs,
there are things that residents can do to minimize the risk and help us respond promptly and appropriately when there is a
bedbug infestation. If you have any questions at all about bedbugs, please feel free to contact staff or obtain additional
information through pest control services.
How Can I Recognize Bedbugs?
Bedbugs are small insects that feed mainly on human blood. A newly hatched bedbug is semitransparent, light tan in color and
about the size of a poppy seed. Adult bedbugs are flat, have rusty-red-colored oval bodies and are about the size of an apple
seed.
Bedbugs are often easily confused with other small household insects, including carpet beetles, spider beetles, and newly
hatched cockroaches.
Generally bedbugs are identified by their markings, droppings and eggs, although they are also easily visible to the human
eye. They are usually found in mattress seams and tufts, sheets, pillowcases and upholstered furniture. They can also be
found in cracks and crevices of furniture, on baseboards of walls and even on children's stuffed animals.
Bed bugs are most active when we sleep. They crawl onto exposed skin, inject a mild anesthetic and suck up a small amount
of blood. Most people never feel the actual bite.
Some people do not react to bed bug bites, but for those who do, bite marks may appear within minutes or days, usually
where skin is exposed during sleep. They can be small bumps or large itchy welts. The welts usually go away after a few days.
Because the bites may resemble mosquito or other insect bites, a bump or welt alone does not mean there are bedbugs.
Where Do I Look to See If I Have Bed Bugs?
• Look for bed bugs, bloodstains, droppings and eggs, primarily in an area 10-20 feet around where you sleep or sit. That's
the distance a bedbug will usually travel.
• Check the top and bottom seams, tufts and any rips in the covers of mattresses and box springs.
• Look underneath the bed and along the bed frame and headboards.
• Check cracks and crevices of furniture, windows and doorframes.
• Check walls and wall hangings and in electrical outlets and light switches.
Are Bed Bugs Disease Carriers?
No. Although bedbugs and their bites are a nuisance they are not known to spread disease. Most welts heal in a few days.
Using an anti-itching ointment usually helps, but if bites become infected persons should consult their physicians.
What Can I Do If I Have Bedbugs?
If you believe you have bed bugs notify your landlord immediately. Anyone can get bed bugs, but major infestations occur only
when they are not promptly reported and treated.
Do not attempt to treat bed bug infestations yourself. Bedbug infestations usually require the use of pesticides and only
licensed pest control operators can legally administer these pesticides. Foggers and bug bombs are not effective against
them.
Once you have reported the possibility of bedbugs, management will arrange for an inspection and, if the bedbugs are verified,
for treatment. Prior to the start of the treatment, you will be given detailed instructions about how to prepare for the treatment.
You must fully comply with those instructions because any failure to comply may result in ineffective treatment and recurrence
of the infestation.
After your apartment is treated thoroughly clean your carpets, floors, bed frames and furniture, and dispose of any dead bugs,
blood stains, eggs or droppings with hot soapy water. Wash all items showing bedbug stains - and any items which you
suspect may have been infested - in hot water (140 degrees F) and dry on the highest setting for at least twenty minutes. After
drying store items in sealed plastic bags until you are sure you have gotten rid of the bedbugs.
Enclose any infested mattresses and box springs in a cover that is labeled "allergen rated," "for dust mites," or "for bed bugs"
for at least one year. Periodically check for rips and openings and tape these up. If you see any signs of a re-infestation, notifyEmerson Mill Avenue

How Can I Prevent Bed Bugs?
Bedbugs enter homes by hitchhiking on used furniture, luggage and clothing and traveling along connecting pipes and wiring.
Because the most common ways that bedbugs are introduced into apartment communities are through used mattresses and
other used furniture there are several steps residents can take to prevent a bedbug infestation:
Do not to bring used bed frames, mattresses, box springs or upholstered furniture into the community.
• Do not take furniture that has been discarded by another person into your apartment.
• Check all used or rented furniture for bedbugs.
• Eliminate clutter. The more clutter there is in a unit the more places bedbugs have to hide.
• When traveling inspect the bed and furniture. Keep suitcases off the floor and bed and inspect them before you leave.
• If you suspect that you have been around bedbugs immediately wash and dry all of your clothing on hot settings or store

ADDENDUM TO LEASE AGREEMENT
SECURITY POLICY, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND RELEASE FORM
SECURITY POLICY. Owner does not promise, warrant, or guarantee the safety or security of Residents or their personal
property against the criminal actions of other Residents or third parties. (For purposes of this security policy, "Owner"includes
owner, owner's officers and employees, and owner's property management company, onsite managers, and other owner
representatives, and "Resident" refers to the Resident(s) and their families, occupants, guests and invitees of the Unit.) Owner
is not acting as insurer of Resident. Resident understands and agrees that Owner is limited in its ability to protect Resident
from crime, accident and natural catastrophe and that Resident is better able to evaluate individual risk and loss than Owner
and to obtain insurance to protect against such events. Each Resident has the responsibility to protect himself or herself and
to maintain insurance to protect his or her belongings and person. Owner strongly recommends that Residents contact an
insurance agent to arrange appropriate insurance.
It is a fact that no security system, patrol, or electronic security device can provide protection against crime at every location at
every moment of the day or night. Even elaborate security systems are subject to mechanical malfunction, tampering, human
error or personnel absenteeism, and can be defeated or avoided by clever criminals. Therefore, residents and occupants
should not rely on such systems and should always proceed on the assumption that no security systems exist. Residents
should make no other assumptions regarding security. The best safety measures are those precautions that can be performed
as a matter of common sense and habit. Resident understands that crimes against persons are prevalent, especially in
apartment Communities.
If security systems, security devices, or walk-through drive-through services are utilized at this apartment community, no
representation is made that they will prevent injury, theft or vandalism. Companies or individuals walking or driving the
complex on behalf of Owner are unarmed independent contractors and have no greater authority under the law to restrain or
arrest criminals or to prevent crime than the ordinary citizen. Resident understands and agrees that Owner has no obligation
or liability for the acts or omissions, whether negligent, intentional or otherwise of any agent or employee of any such
independent contractor. Resident acknowledges that Owner is under no duty to inspect, test or repair any security device
unless and until Owner has received written notice from Resident, except when the Lease Term begins and in the case of a
smoke detector, when a new detector is installed by Owner. Owner does not warrant that any security systems, security
devices, services, or persons at this apartment community will discourage or prevent breaches of security, intrusions, thefts, or
incidents of violent crime, and owner has assumed no responsibility or duty with respect to the security of Resident through the
retention of any such independent contractors or the provision of any such security systems, security devices, or services.
Owner reserves the right to reduce, modify or eliminate any such independent contractor's, security system, security devices,
or services (other than those required by law) at any time, without notice to Residents; and such action shall not be a breach of
any obligation or warranty on the part of Owner. "Neighborhood Crime Watch" signs, if any, do not imply safety or security.
If controlled access gates or intrusion alarms are provided, Residents will be furnished written operating instructions; and it is
Residents'responsibility to read them and to bring any questions to the attention of Owner. Further, it is Residents'
responsibility to promptly notify Owner in writing of any known problem, defect, malfunction or failure of door locks, window
latches, lighting, controlled access gates, intrusion alarms, and other security-related devices. Each Resident is responsible for
reporting to Owner any crime that he or she is aware of and that occurs in Resident's apartment or in common areas near
Resident's apartment. If Resident's apartment is equipped with an intrusion alarm, Resident is responsible for all fines and
other charges resulting from or attributable to the alarm, including false alarm charges. Resident shall pay for and replace
batteries for smoke detectors, if any, and shall pay for monthly service on the electronic alarm systems, if any, unless
otherwise provided in the Lease. Resident shall not disable, disconnect. Or remove batteries from smoke detectors. If
Resident installs additional security devices, Owner shall be given the keys, codes or operating device immediately upon
installation and any such devices installed by Resident must comply with all applicable federal state, municipal or other
governmental law, code, regulation or order.
Protecting Residents from crime is the sole responsibility of Residents and law enforcement agencies. Residents are required
to call the police or 911 first if a crime occurs or is suspected. Residents are required to promptly report to Owner in writing any
locks, latches, lighting, overgrown shrubbery, fences, gates, intrusion alarm, and other security-related devices that they
believe are in need of repair or improvement. Any notices or requests by Resident for inspection, installation or repair of
security devices or smoke detectors must be in writing. Resident recognizes that Owner's efforts are voluntary and not
obligatory and are done in an effort to protect his or her safety.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND RELEASE BY RESIDENTS. Resident has read, understood, and agrees to the above securityEmerson Mill Avenue

D7A4B0EFpolicy. Resident has received no representations or warranties, either express or implied, regarding security or security
systems before or during the lease term. Owner has not stated or implied to Resident in any way that security of person or
property will be provided, promised, or guaranteed. Owner has not represented that the apartment community has been or will
be free from crime or that the apartment community has had little or no history of crime. Resident further acknowledges that
Owner is not obligated under any circumstances to respond to any signal from an intrusion alarm system. Resident agrees to
read the "Guidelines for Resident Safety" attached to the lease and to abide by those guidelines to the fullest extent
reasonably possible.
RESIDENT HEREBY AGREES TO RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD OWNER HARMLESS FROM LOSSES, CLAIMS,
AND COSTS (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES) WITH RESPECT TO ANY PERSONAL INJURY,
PROPERTY DAMAGE OR DEATH ARISING OUT OF CRIMINAL ACTS OF OTHER RESIDENTS AND THIRD PARTIES,

INSTALLATION, USE, OR MALFUNCTION OF ANY SECURITY DEVICE INSTALLED OR CAUSED TO BE INSTALLED

NEGLIGENCE OF OWNER. RESIDENT THEREFOR AGREES THAT OWNER'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THAT
EXPRESSED IN THIS LEASE AND THIS ADDENDUM. Resident acknowledges that Owner's representatives have no
authority to make changes or modifications in this document unless they are in writing and signed by an authorized
representative of Owner.

collection is $0.00per month. A container will be provided to each resident and must be used in conjunction with the valet

If any resident misses service on any of the designated nights, it is their responsibility to bring trash to the designated

stairwells are designed as the primary method by which Resident shall access upper levels of the building from the ground
floor of the same.
2.Resident accepts, understands, and agrees that from time-to-time and at the sole discretion of Management, access to the
elevator may be limited, curtailed, or denied to Resident due to the needs of Management, including but not limited to

SMOKE-FREE ADDENDUM TO LEASE AGREEMENT
Management has become increasingly aware of the ill effects caused by secondhand smoke. These ill effects include, but are
not limited to (1) additional costs for maintenance such as cleaning, painting, curtain and carpet replacement and grounds
keeping; (2) safety concerns resulting from smokers disconnecting the smoke alarms in their units; and (3) health concerns
raised by other tenants who experience secondhand smoke filtering into adjoining apartments, with resulting increased
potential for lung related illnesses and disorders.
Moreover, the Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand tobacco smoke as a Class A carcinogen and the
U.S. Surgeon General has identified secondhand tobacco smoke as the third leading cause of preventable death.
In response to these concerns and in order to provide a safe living environment for all Residents, Resident and Management
agree as follows:
1.The term "smoking" means inhaling, exhaling, breathing or carrying any lighted cigar, cigarette, or other tobacco product or
similar lighted or electronic product in any manner or in any form.
2.Resident agrees and acknowledges that the premises to be occupied by Resident and members of Resident's household
have been designated as a smoke-free living environment. Resident and members of Resident's household shall not
smoke anywhere in the unit leased by Resident, or in the building where Resident's unit is located, or in any common
areas utilized by Residents and staff.
3.Residents are responsible for notifying their guests and invitees that Management has designed the property as a
smoke-free property and that smoking is prohibited everywhere on the property. Residents are responsible for ensuring
that their guests and any and all visitors under their control fully comply with this policy.
4.Smoking shall be prohibited throughout the entire property, including but not limited to the following areas:
• All designated common areas, including but not limited to sports court, swimming pool, spa, and other recreational
shared areas.
5.Resident agrees to promptly provide Management with a written statement of any incident where tobacco smoke is
migrating into Resident's unit from sources outside Resident's unit.
6.Management shall post No Smoking signs at entrances and exits, common areas, hallways and in conspicuous places
adjoining the grounds of the property.
7.Management agrees that it shall take reasonable steps to enforce this Smoke-Free Addendum and to make the property
smoke-free. Management is not required to take steps in response to smoking unless Management knows of a violation of
this Smoke-Free Addendum or has been provided with written notice of any violation of this Addendum.
8.A breach of this Addendum shall give each party all the rights contained herein, as well as the rights under the Lease. A
material breach of this Addendum shall be a material breach of the lease and grounds for termination of tenancy.
9.Resident acknowledges that Management's adoption of a Smoke-Free living environment and its efforts to designate the
property as Smoke-Free do not make Management, Owner or any agent of Management or Owner a guarantor of
Resident's health or of the smoke-free condition of Resident's unit or the common areas. Resident acknowledges that
Management's adoption of a smoke-free living environment and its efforts to designate the property as smoke-free do not
in any way change the standard of care that Owner, Management or any agent of Owner or Management would have to
Resident's household to render buildings and premises designated as smoke-free any safer, more habitable, or improved
in terms of air quality standards than any other rental premises. Owner and Management specifically disclaim any implied
or express warranties that the building, common areas or Resident's premises will have any higher or improved air quality
standards than any other rental property. Management and Owner cannot and does not warranty or promise that the rental

UTILITY BILLING LEASE ADDENDUM
This Utility Addendum is incorporated into the Lease and is in addition to all terms and conditions contained in the Lease. To
the extent that the terms of this Utility Addendum conflict with any provisions of the Lease, this Utility Addendum controls.
Purpose of Addendum. When utility bills are paid by the Landlord ("Management"), residents have no incentive to conserve.
This results in an unnecessary waste of our natural resources and adds to the overhead of the property, which can translate to
higher rents. A recent (2004) EPA sponsored study showed that properties that bill residents for utilities use, on average,
15.3% less than properties that include the cost of utilities in with the rent.
Utility Charges ARE NOT Included in Rent but are Due and Payable as Additional Rent. Resident understands that the
Total Monthly Rent Under Resident's Apartment Lease does not include charges for utilities and agrees to pay for all utilities,
including but not limited to, the utilities covered by this Utility Addendum, as a payment separate from the Total Monthly Rent
but which is due and payable as additional rent.
Monthly Utility Billing. Resident will be billed by Conservice for the utilities described below plus applicable taxes thereupon
on a monthly basis. The ratio utility billing system method of allocation used to determine the monthly utility charges for
Resident's apartment will be based on:
Water: Individually Submetered. This charge is based on Resident’s actual consumption as reported by
the submeter at the Apartment Unit.
Common Water: Number of Occupants. Usage attributed to common areas (if such is not separately submetered
from the apartment units, it shall be defined as the Property’s total usage less the total value of the
readings on the submeters attached to the apartment units) will be billed to Resident on a
proportionate amount calculated monthly as the number of occupants in the Apartment Unit
divided by the number of occupants in all apartment units. New residents will have their charges
prorated based upon the number of days they occupied their Apartment Unit in the previous
month, and residents whose leases conclude on a day other than the last day of the month (and
who surrender possession upon or before that day) shall have their charges prorated based upon
the number of days they leased the Apartment Unit in that month.
Sewer: Individually Submetered. This charge is based on Resident’s actual consumption as reported by
the submeter at the Apartment Unit.
Common Sewer: Number of Occupants. Usage attributed to common areas (if such is not separately submetered
from the apartment units, it shall be defined as the Property’s total usage less the total value of the
readings on the submeters attached to the apartment units) will be billed to Resident on a
proportionate amount calculated monthly as the number of occupants in the Apartment Unit
divided by the number of occupants in all apartment units. New residents will have their charges
prorated based upon the number of days they occupied their Apartment Unit in the previous
month, and residents whose leases conclude on a day other than the last day of the month (and
who surrender possession upon or before that day) shall have their charges prorated based upon
the number of days they leased the Apartment Unit in that month.
Common Gas: Number of Occupants. Usage attributed to common areas will be billed to Resident on a
proportionate amount calculated monthly as the number of occupants in the Apartment Unit
divided by the number of occupants in all apartment units. New residents will have their charges
prorated based upon the number of days they occupied their Apartment Unit in the previous
month, and residents whose leases conclude on a day other than the last day of the month (and
who surrender possession upon or before that day) shall have their charges prorated based upon
the number of days they leased the Apartment Unit in that month. Please note that there is no
natural gas service to individual apartment units.
Electricity: Resident’s Direct Responsibility. Resident must establish an account with the utility service
provider directly. In the event that Resident fails to do so and service is billed to Landlord,
regardless of all other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity Resident agrees to
immediately reimburse Landlord for the utility charges.
Common Electricity: Number of Occupants. Usage attributed to common areas and vacant apartment units will be
billed to Resident on a proportionate amount calculated monthly as the number of occupants in the
Apartment Unit divided by the number of occupants in all apartment units. New residents will have
their charges prorated based upon the number of days they occupied their Apartment Unit in the
previous month, and residents whose leases conclude on a day other than the last day of the
month (and who surrender possession upon or before that day) shall have their charges prorated
based upon the number of days they leased the Apartment Unit in that month.Emerson Mill Avenue

Additional Provisions
1.In addition to payment of the utility charges outlined above, Resident agrees to be responsible for payment of an
Administrative Fee (Billing Fee) of $3.00per month and a onetime New Account Set-up Fee of $10.00. Resident agrees
that the amount of both the monthly Administrative Fee and the one time New Account Fee is fair and reasonable.
2.Resident understands that all charges and fees must be paid in full by the due date printed on each month's billing
statement. Landlord possesses the right to reject any tender of rent payment that does not include these utilities charges
pursuant to A.R.S. § 33-1371. As set forth within the lease, a Late Fee will be assessed if payment in full is not made by
the due date. Resident understands and agrees that determining the actual cost to Landlord and/or Conservice when
Resident fails to pay on time is impractical or extremely difficult to ascertain, but agrees that certain costs do occur and
that the Late Fee specified in the lease is fair and reasonable compensation for those costs.
3.All fraudulent, refuted or dishonored payments, whether by check or credit card, will be assessed a $25.00Reversal Fee
or NSF charge plus applicable Late Fees. Resident understands that the actual cost to Landlord and/or Conservice
when payments are reversed is impractical or extremely difficult to ascertain, but agrees that certain costs do occur and
that the$25.00Reversal Fee or NSF charge is fair and reasonable compensation for those costs.
4.If Resident fails to pay their utility charges by the due date, Resident agrees these charges and fees shall be considered
additional (unpaid) rent and a violation under terms of the Lease. Resident further agrees that Management, at their sole
discretion, can reject any tendered rent payment that does not include the additional payment of all utility charges and
administrative fees due. Resident understands and agrees that Management may bring eviction proceedings
against Resident for failure to pay their utility bill in full .
5.When Resident moves from the property, Management will generate a Final Bill that estimates utility charges from the
end of the last billing cycle to the expected move-out date. All utility and administrative charges, including the estimated
Final Bill, must be paid in full by the move out date. Resident understands and agrees that any outstanding balance due,
if not paid in full by the move out date, will be deducted from the Resident's Security Deposit.
6.Resident agrees that Management shall not be liable for interruption or failure of utility services to resident or for any
damages or inconveniences caused directly or indirectly by interruption or failure of such services.
7.Landlord has the right to change billing service providers and/or modify the method by which utilities are furnished or
billed to Resident during the term of this Lease upon ninety(90)days' written notice to Resident.
8.If any part of this addendum is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that part of the addendum shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remainder of this addendum.
9. Resident Portal. Residents can login to ActiveBuilding to view their utility billing statements and on-line account
information. Each resident’s User Name and PIN (needed to login) are in the top right hand corner of each month’s billing
statement. Residents can also use the Resident Portal to access additional features and find dispute resolution
information.
